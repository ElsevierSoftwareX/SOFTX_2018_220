# About #
Recreation of the 2DBlockCreator project in Java.
This is the beginning of an open-source framework for custom pattern drafting. To begin with, existing pattern drafting
methods for simple items of clothing are being implemented to help inform the design of a high level Block class which
can be used in custom drafting techniques. Software copyright is retained by the The University of Manchester.

# Compiling and Running #
If you are comfortable with compiling and running from teh command line then you can compile using `javac` and run using
`java` in the usual way. To make it more accessible to the expected user base, in future versions I will include some
script files (probably *.bat for Windows might be the most popular option) so the process is a bit easier. You will
still need to make sure you have the JRE installed beforehand though and the standard environment variables set for the
Java executables.
